We are committed to providing exceptional pets to wonderful people. We have a couple fantastic pets that just didn\u2019t quite meet our breeding standards. It was disappointing, but we would rather be confident that we provide you a top quality golden than sell you a cute puppy and hope you never have problems.<\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\n\t\n\n<\/div>\n\t<div id=\"gap-511418335\" class=\"gap-element clearfix\" style=\"display:block; height:auto;\">\n\t\t\n<style scope=\"scope\">\n\n#gap-511418335 {\n  padding-top: 30px;\n}\n<\/style>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n<div class=\"row\"  id=\"row-1437360550\">\n\n\n\t<div class=\"col medium-4 small-12 large-4\"  >\n\t\t<div class=\"col-inner\"  >\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #450000;\">Our Social Responsibility<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">As well as giving your Teacup  Poodle&#8217;s physical and mental exercise, you should also be prepared to include him in your family activities.
